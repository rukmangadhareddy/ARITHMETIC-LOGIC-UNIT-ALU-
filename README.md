## I have use different domains of alu opeartors and they perform the operations which was theroticaly and practically to make as in digital design and how to use i toll based output to getting by using the mentor graphics or questa and moba xtream are used to modify the alu code based operations on the verilog rtl and tb  codes are to debug the code and finally get the appropriate outputs based on the current outpouts are near by theorically i am try to getting work on good process to make it results and in out group in youtube vidoes good explaantion of this codetech internship to perform and anylysis the better knowledge to improve to create thier own codes and simple to performed .The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a crucial part of a CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations on data, using logic gates to execute instructions like addition, subtraction, and logical comparisons  so it worked based on the instructiuon based only which was giver operator it will perform and give excat results .
